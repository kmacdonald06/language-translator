## Labeling and deleting data in Language Translator
{: #gdpr-in-service}

The {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} service temporarily caches translation data from translation requests and stores training data that is used to create custom models.

### Translation data

When you send text to {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} in the **Translate** method, the service caches the source text and the translation result to improve performance when it receives the same text in subsequent **Translate** requests. Cached translation text is deleted only after it is not used for a period of 15 days.

### Custom model training data

When you train a custom model, the training data that you use to create the model is stored to provide you with the custom model. The training data persists in storage until the model is deleted with the **Delete model** method.

Custom models can only be deleted at the model level. Component data used to create a custom model cannot be deleted. If you use personal data when creating a custom model, a separate custom model must be created for each customer and the model `name` labeled to identify the customer so it can be deleted if requested.
