# Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} API v3 with Neural Machine Translation
{: #migrating-to-v3}

{{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} API v2 is now retired in favor of API v3. Service enhancements will no longer be made to the v2 API. To take advantage of new features and updates, please migrate your application to {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} v3.
{: shortdesc}

## What's new in v3
{: #whats-new}

-  {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} API v3 comes with **Neural Machine Translation** (NMT) models that offer significantly improved translation results. All NMT models are now available for customization.
-  Use custom models as base models for forced glossary customization.
-  API v3 is a simplified, all-JSON subset of the retired API v2.
-  Introduces API version dates to give developers the freedom to adopt future API changes at their own pace.

## Breaking changes
{: #breaking-changes}

- Mandatory version date for all API endpoints: API v3 requests require a version date query parameter of the form `version=yyyy-dd-mm`. The latest API version is `version=2018-05-01`.
- Simplified API:
  - The **Translate** and **Identify** methods do not offer the option to return plain text responses in v3.
  - `GET /translate` and `GET /identify` methods are not supported in v3. Use the `POST /translate` and `POST /identify` methods instead. 
- Monolingual corpus customization is not supported in v3.
- Creating custom models with both a parallel corpus and forced glossary now needs to be done in two API calls. First, customize the model with a parallel corpus. After the custom model has finished training, customize it again with the forced glossary. This change allows to quickly decorate an existing custom model with an updated glossary instead of requiring to retrain a custom model from scratch.
- Specialized patent and conversation domain models are not available in API v3. The translation quality provided by the NMT models in the patent and conversation domains is generally improved compared to the older specialized models.
- Error object keys have been renamed so that they are consistent with other Watson APIs. `error_code` has been renamed to `code`, and `error_message` has been renamed to `error`.


## Migrating your application
{: #migrating-your-application}

Support for {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} v3 is now available in the [Watson SDKs](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-sdks.html)
{: tip}

Before you migrate your application to {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} v3, make sure that your API calls conform to the v3 API syntax. See the [API reference](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/language-translator/api/v3) for details and examples. You can call the v3 API with the same credentials that you use to call the v2 API.

## Migrating custom models
{: #migrating-custom-models}

Custom models that you have trained with {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} v2 are not compatible with the new Neural Machine Translation technology in {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} v3. To use your custom models with {{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorshort}} v3, [customize your models again](customizing.html) with the v3 API. The v3 API supports forced glossary and parallel corpus customization.

In v3, you will not be able to customize a model with a parallel corpus and forced glossary in a single API call. To customize a model with both a parallel corpus and a forced glossary, you need to do it in two steps. First, customize a base model with a parallel corpus. After the model is available, use the model ID of the available custom model as the base model for forced glossary customization.
